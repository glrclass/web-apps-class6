# Class 6 notes

# In terminal- did 4 different commands to kick things off

# Rails db:setup
# rails db:migrate
# rails runner scripts/create_data.rb
# Rails server 

# Rails db:setup #only do this once, after this it will always be rails db:migrate

# Go into config > routes.rb and input string

# rails generate controller tacos
# rails server

# 5. then add the variable you defined as an action into the controller that you created for tacos

inside the class in the tacos_controller.rb 

def index #the name we used as action
  render :inline => "Test"
end

# 6. Then go to app > views > tacos.
# Add a new file and call it index.html.erb (or whatever action.html.erb)
# Update controller to REPLACE previous inline rendering to     
# render :template => "tacos/index"
